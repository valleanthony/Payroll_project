#Calculate employee's pay

A program is required by a company to read an employee’s number, pay rate and 
the number of hours worked in a week. The program is then to validate the pay rate 
field and the hours worked field and, if valid, compute the employee’s weekly pay and 
then print it and the input data.

Weekly pay calculation: Weekly pay is calculated as hours worked times pay rate. If 
more than 35 hours are worked, payment for the overtime hours worked is calculated at 
time-and-a-half.

##Updates that need to be made:
*Vlaidation of user input for hours and rate.
